# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
echo "# appwriteProject"

/*
1.. install packges
2.. create project and databbase and collection and bucket in appwrite 
3.. create envoirment variable with its id's and its separate file for acessing 
4.. create authentication packge for login , logout,sig up
5.. create  and delete and update posts and file service in appwrite
6.. set up redux toolkit store and add authenntiaction to app.jsx  
7.. create container and and header and footer and also create components in production way
8.. craete sign-up and log_in using react hook form and auth layout for protection
9.. we can also give the component reference without using forwardREf so we used controller for complex components for this  and also create a form  in which we used slug transformation function 
*/

... register for simple components 
... controller for complex components

imp:
The register function is provided by React Hook Form and is used to connect an input field to the form state.
register metho is used when we used the forwardRef ,,,,and "control" is used when we used the react hook form
we could apply validation by using rule keyword in control
